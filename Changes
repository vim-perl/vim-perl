[FIXES]
Minor tweak to p6RxCharClass.  Thanks, Arne Skj√¶rholt.

Fixed a problem with folding subs caused by rules being out of
order.  Thanks, Christian J. Robinson.
(http://github.com/petdance/vim-perl/issues/closed#issue/28)

Fixed bug where backslashes would be seen as closing a set of braces,
thus screwing up indents.  Thanks, Tom Wyant.

Fixed highlights on comments before opening brace of a sub. Thanks,
Rafael Kitover.

Braces within a heredoc no longer confuse the highlighting.

Keyword detection for "accept" was looking for "acept".

Added highlighting for "import" and "format".
