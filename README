This is the aggregation of all the various Perl-related syntax and
helper files for Perl 5 and Perl 6.

You can install vim-perl using

* Pathogen and git submodules
* Vundle

Both were tested and work: please read the related documentation on the related sites.

The legacy method is to install just do a "make install" and you'll get the
.vim files all installed in your ~/.vim directory.
